After using both Speech to text AI feature for both GCP and Azure. What I noticed is that GCP was a lot easier to use but the reflection when speech to text translation seems less accurate. I needed to keep recapturing it or needed to revise it in order for it to be correct. Where as Azure was hard to use but the Speech to Text translation was way more accuarate on the first try and capture voice with ease.
